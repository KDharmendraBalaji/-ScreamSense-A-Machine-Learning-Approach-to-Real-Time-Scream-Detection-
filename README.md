# Scream Sense: A Machine Learning Approach to Real-Time Scream Detection

Welcome to **Scream Sense**! This project leverages machine learning to detect screams in real-time using audio inputs. It can be applied in various fields such as safety systems, entertainment, and even research in sound analysis. The system analyzes sound signals and distinguishes screams from other environmental noises.

---

## Features

- **Real-time scream detection:** The model processes audio inputs and identifies whether a scream is present.
- **Efficient and lightweight:** Optimized for quick inference, allowing deployment on various devices.
- **Machine learning-based:** Built on advanced ML algorithms for accurate classification of scream vs non-scream sounds.
- **Open-source and customizable:** Users can tweak the model, retrain it with new data, and integrate it into their own applications.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip (for package management)

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scream-sense.git
cd scream-sense
```

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

To use the real-time scream detection model, run the following script:

```bash
python detect_scream.py
```

This will start the system to listen to the microphone input and output whether a scream is detected or not in real-time.

### Command Line Arguments

- `--model_path`: Path to the trained model. If not specified, the default model is used.
- `--threshold`: Scream detection threshold for classification (default is 0.5).
- `--audio_source`: Source of the audio input, can be a file path or microphone. (default is microphone)

Example command:

```bash
python detect_scream.py --model_path models/scream_model.h5 --threshold 0.7 --audio_source microphone
```

---

## Model

The core of this project is a **neural network** model trained to recognize screams in audio. We used a combination of **MFCCs** (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) and **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to process and classify the audio data.

### Pre-trained Model

If you prefer to use a pre-trained model, you can download it from our [model release page](#) or run the following command:

```bash
wget https://linktothemodel.com/scream_model.h5
```

### Training

If you'd like to train your own model, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare your dataset**: Collect a dataset of scream and non-scream audio samples.
2. **Preprocess the data**: Extract features like MFCCs from your audio files.
3. **Train the model**: Run the training script to train the neural network.

For training instructions, please refer to the [training guide](docs/training.md).

---

## Data

This model uses audio files, ideally with labeled scream and non-scream categories.

- **Audio format**: WAV or MP3 (Mono)
- **Sample rate**: 16 kHz or higher
- **Duration**: Each clip should be around 1-5 seconds

You can use your own dataset or leverage pre-built datasets such as:

- [UrbanSound8K](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html)
- [ESC-50](https://github.com/karolpiczak/ESC-50)

For more details on how to prepare your dataset, refer to the [data preparation guide](docs/data_preparation.md).

---

## Training

To train the model, use the following command:

```bash
python train_model.py --data_path /path/to/data --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
```

- `--data_path`: Path to the folder containing your preprocessed audio files.
- `--epochs`: Number of epochs to train the model.
- `--batch_size`: Batch size for training.

After training, the model will be saved to `models/scream_model.h5`.
